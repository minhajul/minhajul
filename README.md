# Hi 👋, I’m Md Minhajul Islam (minhajul)

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a full-stack Software Developer with a strong foundation in **PHP/Laravel, JavaScript, Node.js, Golang**, and **Next.js**, and practical experience working with **AWS, Docker, Terraform** and scalable architectures.  
I enjoy building robust backend systems, scalable cloud infrastructure, and performant web applications.  

- 🌍 Based in **Dhaka, Bangladesh** — open to **remote roles** or **relocation**.  
- 🔭 Currently exploring opportunities in backend development, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack engineering.  
- 💡 Strong interest in distributed systems, scalable microservices and CI/CD automation.  

## 🧰 My Tech Stack & Skills  

| Category | Skills / Tools |
|---------|----------------|
| Languages | PHP, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Go, Python |
| Frameworks / Platforms | Laravel, Next.js, Node.js, Django |
| DevOps / Cloud | AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, IAM, KMS, Lambda), Docker, Terraform, Redis, PostgreSQL, MySQL |
| Infrastructure & Architecture | Microservices, Distributed Queues, Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, Observability (Prometheus / Grafana / OpenTelemetry) |
| Testing & Quality | PHPUnit (for PHP), Unit & Integration Testing, CI/CD pipelines |
| Other | REST APIs, GraphQL, S3, Packer, CloudFormation / Terraform, Security & Cost Optimization |

## 💼 Notable Projects & Work  

Here are some of the repositories I’m most proud of — a mix of infrastructure tooling, cloud automation, and web apps:

- **[`docker-cleaner`](https://github.com/minhajul/docker-cleaner)** — A TUI tool in Go (using BubbleTea) to clean up Docker images and containers, useful for keeping dev environments tidy and efficient.  
- **[`aws-machine-image-using-packer`](https://github.com/minhajul/aws-machine-image-using-packer)** — Packer configuration to build pre-configured AMIs with PHP + Nginx, for faster provisioning of environments.  
- **[`learning-terraform`](https://github.com/minhajul/learning-terraform)** — A set of Terraform configurations to spin up AWS infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2, autoscaling, networking), reflecting my infra-as-code skills.  
- **[`laravel-grafana`](https://github.com/minhajul/laravel-grafana)** — A monitoring setup for Laravel apps using Grafana, Prometheus and Loki, showing my focus on observability and production-grade deployments.  
- **[`download-s3-bucket`](https://github.com/minhajul/download-s3-bucket)** — A small Node.js utility to download and zip entire S3 buckets — a handy tool for backups or migrations.

## ✅ What I’m Looking For  

- A challenging **full-stack or backend engineering** role where I can leverage my skills in cloud, infrastructure-as-code and web development.  
- A team that values **scalability, clean architecture, and maintainable code**.  
- Open to **remote work** or **relocation** internationally.  
- Excited to collaborate, mentor (or be mentored), and grow with a dynamic, cross-disciplinary team.
